Gesture recognition for Android Wear (Xamarin, F#)
====================================================

This a research app that demonstrates the idea of using 'functional' state machines for gesture recognition

It is writtin in F# and uses the Xamarin toolkit.

Note: To use F# with Xamarin install the F# 3.1.2 runtime first (this was true as of Oct 2015 but may change in the future).
