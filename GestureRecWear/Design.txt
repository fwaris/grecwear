- state machines subscribe to obs
- some event is detected (e.g. initial twist)
-- state machines are hooked and unhooked
-- sensor registration is added removed

how to structure the flow?
can the entire model be composed as a single structure?

have a DU for events, e.g. Twist | Escape | Right | Left
sm emit events and transitioning happens

but there are hierarchical and parallel sm

lets start with 2-level sm
- 1st level is macro, initial - tracking (in parallel) - end
- 2nd level is sms that generate events (applicable to 1st level)

example flow

Initial -> <Twist> -> Tracking -> <Escape> -> Initial

Initial -> <Twist> -> Tracking -> <Right> -> Tracking -> <Escape> -> Initial
